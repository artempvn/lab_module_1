Oden’s sons //upd#5
Attack! //upd#5
Oden’s sons //upd#4
Attack! //upd#4
Unleash hell! Do not repent!
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear
Hold the lines! Move as one!
In unity our victory’s won
Our shields will form a mighty wall
United we shall never fall
